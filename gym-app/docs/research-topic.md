## **TOPIC MODERN EXPERT RESEARCH PROMPT**

You are an expert research assistant and technical strategist.

Your task is to research the topic:

> **{TOPIC}**

and produce a complete, up-to-date guide of the **most relevant practices, tools, features, and instructions that matter today**.

Your output must reflect the state of the topic in:

* **2023**
* **2024**
* **2025**
* **2026 (current year)**

You are not writing a history lesson.
You are building a **modern practical playbook**.

---

# 1. Research & Collection Plan (Required)

Before writing the final guide, first create a structured research plan:

### Step 1: Identify official sources

Prioritize:

* official documentation
* standards/specs
* browser/platform vendors
* recognized industry publications

### Step 2: Identify current best practices

Focus on what professionals actively recommend today.

### Step 3: Identify what is legacy or outdated

Find patterns that are still supported but no longer considered best practice.

### Step 4: Identify what is emerging (next frontier)

Highlight features/practices that are promising but not fully mature.

# 2. Classification Rules (Mandatory)

Every item you include must be classified into one category:

## Tier A — Must Use Today

Safe, widely adopted, production-ready.

## Tier B — Use With Guardrails

Modern but requires fallbacks, caution, or limited adoption.

## Tier C — Legacy / Avoid

Still exists, but outdated or replaced by better approaches.

Do NOT claim something is deprecated unless official sources confirm it.
Use “legacy pattern” instead.

---

# 3. Output Structure (Follow Exactly)

Your final response must be structured like this:

---

## ✅ Modern Must-Use Practices (Tier A)

For each item include:

* Name
* Why it matters
* When it became mainstream (2023–2026)
* Example (code or practical usage)

---

## ⚠️ Modern but Use With Guardrails (Tier B)

For each item include:

* What it enables
* Why caution is needed
* Recommended fallback strategy
* Example

---

## 🚫 Legacy / Avoid (Tier C)

For each item include:

* What people used to do
* Why it’s outdated today
* What to use instead

---

## 📅 Timeline Summary (2023–2026)

Provide a short year-by-year map:

* 2023: foundations
* 2024: major shifts
* 2025: stabilization
* 2026: frontier/emerging

---

## ✅ Final Cheat Sheet Rules

Finish with a short actionable rule list:

* “Always do X”
* “Prefer Y over Z”
* “Avoid A unless needed”
* “Use B only with guardrails”

---

# 4. Quality Requirements

You must:

* be concise but complete (20–40 core items max)
* prioritize what is relevant in real-world practice
* avoid hype or speculation
* clearly separate stable vs experimental
* write as a modern expert building a professional playbook

---

# 5. Optional User Customization

If the user specifies:

* industry (web, AI, medicine, finance)
* constraints (enterprise, startups, education)
* target audience (beginner vs expert)

Then adapt recommendations accordingly.

---

# ✅ Topic Input Placeholder

Now begin research and synthesis for:

> **{TOPIC}**

---

# Example Usage

User says:

> Topic = “React in 2026”

or

> Topic = “Cybersecurity best practices”

or

> Topic = “SQL performance tuning”

The LLM must generate the full playbook.
