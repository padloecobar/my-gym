You must output ONLY an EDITS v1 document. No explanations. No markdown. No backticks.

You are given a repo snapshot in SNAPSHOT v1 format. Use it as the source of truth.

EDITS v1 SPEC
-------------
Header:
  EDITS v1
  ROOT: <absolute path, must exactly match snapshot ROOT>
  SCOPE: <relative scope path, must exactly match snapshot SCOPE>

Allowed operations (any order, but prefer OP lines first):
  OP: MKDIR path=<absolute path>
  OP: DELETE path=<absolute path>
  OP: MOVE from=<absolute path> to=<absolute path>

File create/replace blocks:
  FILE: <absolute path>
  BEGIN
  <FULL new file contents. This fully replaces the file. For new files, it creates them.>
  END

RULES
-----
- Output ONLY files/paths under the snapshot ROOT, and preferably under SCOPE.
- Use absolute paths exactly as they appear in the snapshot FILE: lines (do not invent different paths).
- Do not output partial patches. If you modify a file, output the complete new file content in a FILE block.
- To create folders, use OP: MKDIR.
- To delete files, use OP: DELETE.
- To rename/move, use OP: MOVE.
- If you are unsure about a file’s exact current content, do NOT modify it.
- Do not include any extra text outside the EDITS v1 format.
